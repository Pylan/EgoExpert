    "Expert commentary:\n",
    "0:13 Here the preparer is cutting some onion. However, she is cutting on a metal plate. The issue with this is that your knife blade will dull as it hits that metal plate. So a proper cutting board should be utilized to preserve the sharpness of the knife.\n",
    "0:19 Here we go, we can see the individual here. Looks like she's getting some ingredients prepped. Looks like she peeled the onion and she's cutting it. I would prefer to see her using a cutting board. When you use a bowl or something it could cause damage to the knife. It's just not not good habit.\n",
    "0:28 With the chili, I would like to see her split it in half at least. And then, you know, get a real fine dice on it. Just because they are pretty spicy, it's not something you'd want to get a big choke of.\n",
    "0:29 Here a small chili is being sliced on the same metal plate as the onion. Again, a cutting board would be a much better surface to be doing the chopping on.\n",
    "0:59 Here the vegetables are being seasoned. Typically for an omelet, the seasonings would be salt and pepper, specifically white pepper, so as not to have the black flecks of ground black pepper. However, due to cultural differences and preferences, other spices may be added to the dish.\n",
    "01:01 There we go, she added her spices and salt.\n",
    "01:17 Here, a medium-sized sauté pan is placed over a lit burner. For an omelette, a small sauté pan, 6 to 8 inches in diameter or 15 to 20 centimeters in diameter would be the preferred size to use for a classic omelette.\n",
    "01:22 You don't want to use your knife to crack the egg. It actually pushes eggshells into the egg. Something like a flat surface like the counter or even that plate or whatever it is would work just fine.\n",
    "01:28 The preparer cracks one egg into the bowl containing the seasonings, onion, and chili, and is using a spoon to mix the eggs. So a better tool to use would be either a fork, chopsticks, or a small wire whisk. You want to make sure that you get a good mixing of the eggs so that the yolk and the white are well mixed together. What you're trying to avoid is streaks of the egg white ending up in the final product. Secondly, the vegetables. In a classic omelet, those vegetables should be sautéed separately from the eggs, removed from the pan, the omelet is then made, and the sautéed vegetables are added at the end, either on the omelet before it's folded over, or if you're creating a rolled omelet, you're going to roll your omelet, place it on your serving plate, cut a slit in the middle on top, and place your sautéed vegetables in that slit.\n",
    "01:31 Also, I'd like to see her using a whisk instead of a spoon. You want to incorporate as much air into the egg as possible.\n",
    "01:42 Also, I would like to see her do a little sauté on the veg before adding the egg. The egg's going to cook way faster than the vegetables. It's going to cause raw chunks of onion and chili pepper in there.\n",
    "01:51 Here the preparer is adding some oil to the pan which has been heated on the burner. While oil is certainly fine for making an omelet, the preferred fat would be clarified butter. This is butter where the milk solids and water have been removed. And it allows the butter to reach a higher temperature without browning. You could also use whole butter, but have to be very, very careful with the heat level. When making the omelet.\n",
    "01:57 You can see she added a little bit of oil. I think butter is far better for an omelette, but oil is not the worst option.\n",
    "01:57 The egg is being added to the sauté pan here and there is a very loud sizzling sound when that egg hits the pan. This is an indication that the pan is too hot and likely will result in browning of the underside of the egg. With a classic omelette, you're trying not to brown the egg so that you have just a beautiful yellow colored egg without any browning.\n",
    "02:11 The egg is allowed to cook in a thin layer and the preparer is also drizzling a little bit of additional oil onto the top of the egg mixture. So with a classic omelet, once you add your eggs to the pan, you're going to want to use a rubber spatula or metal, or I'm sorry, rubber spatula or wooden spoon to gently stir the egg until the curds form. Once the curds start to form, you're going to let that egg cook on a low heat until it is set, appears shiny and moist on the outside. At that point, your egg will be done for your omelet and then you would either fold it or roll it. There's no reason to add additional oil to the top of the egg as it's cooking.\n",
    "02:16 Here, she's using a spatula to ladle oil out. A ladle would work far better. Here, she's only getting a couple drops. It seems like it's actually kind of a waste of time.\n",
    "02:34 The preparer is utilizing a metal spatula to attempt to flip this layer of egg that is cooking. Unfortunately, the egg breaks so that it's being flipped in a couple of pieces. So with a traditional omelet, one would not be flipping the egg. You would be using a smaller saucepan and you would have more depth to the egg mixture. And then you would just let it cook once the curds had formed.\n",
    "02:37 You can see the egg has a dark brown color on it here. Like I said, those vegetables are going to be raw and the egg is already overcooked. Also you should have whipped the egg in the pan, got a little fluff out of it, and actually rolled it like an omelet. I understand this must be a different style of omelet, more like a frittata or a scramble.\n",
    "02:49 There we go, she has a ladle.\n",
    "02:51 Here additional oil is being added to the eggs which have been flipped over. This is an unnecessary step. It's just going to create a greasy end product.\n",
    "02:53 However, this does seem like quite a bit of oil for the amount of egg that she's cooking.\n",
    "02:59 Here the egg is being flipped over again. You can see that it is quite brown from the high heat. So again with a classic omelet you're not doing any flipping, you're just allowing the curds to form and then allowing the egg to set before it's removed from the stove.\n",
    "03:07 Here the egg is being removed from the pan. So if you were making a traditional French omelet, at this point you would either fold your omelet or you would roll your omelet and then plate it. If you had filling that you previously sautéed, you would place that on the omelet if you're folding it before folding it over, or if you're rolling it you're going to roll the omelet, place it on your serving plate, cut a slit in the middle top of that rolled omelet and place your sautéed vegetables there.\n",

    "Expert commentary:\n",
    "0:06 So to start I'd say typically you don't sit down to cut. Now I'm not exactly sure what the circumstances here. He does have adequate counter space that is regular height to cut on. He just may be used to doing it this way but I would encourage anyone at the beginning of their culinary journey to not take this as the norm. It's not a good position to be in. It's you just don't have a lot of control when you're seated and cutting.\n",
    "0:07 First of all, I would like to see him giving himself more room to work with. He's got a whole bunch of ingredients that has nothing to do with the dish that he's making. He's making cucumber tomato salad. He has eggs. Yes. Sugar. He has a little bit of everything in his work area. So he should be able to give himself some room just so he can get stuff done in a timely fashion and not be working in a bunch of clutter.\n",
    "0:09 The first step to making a cucumber and tomato salad is to gather all of your ingredients that you will need for the recipe and to set up your workspace. You can see here that he has a cutting board and a chef's knife here in front of him. He is sitting in a chair which is never recommended when you're cutting anything. You need to be standing up on flat feet at a workspace that's at an adequate level for your height. However, he does have his ingredients handy. He has some pre-sliced red onion here that he is grabbing from a bowl and transferring to the cutting board in batches.\n",
    "0:11 So he has some already sliced onion here. They're in slivers, and he's just moved a handful of them to his cutting board.\n",
    "0:13 And he's using a technique that's pretty good for keeping your hands out of the way by holding the top of his knife down and then using this hand right here to rock the knife over the onions. It kind of is an indication that he's not very comfortable with his knife and that he's sort of just chopping at it, but it still is better than putting his fingers in jeopardy. Now what would be better is if he actually flattened this hand over the tip of the knife and didn't hold it so close. But again, fingers out of the way is what you're going for.\n",
    "0:15 Here the preparer has taken some sliced onion and is proceeding to chop it up using a chef's knife and using good knife skills where he's holding down the tip of the knife and using his arm to create a rocking motion with the knife to cut the sliced onion. Now an easier way to do this would be to start with either a whole or half an onion. If you're starting with a whole onion, cut it in half, pole to pole, stem to root. Peel it and then make vertical cuts with the point of the knife towards the root but not cutting all the way through the back of the onion. Your vertical cuts are going to be spaced depending on the size of the dice you want. So once you've made your vertical cuts, you're going to turn the onion 90 degrees and cut 90 degrees to the vertical cut, spacing the size you want your dice. And that will give you diced onion very quickly.\n",
    "0:16 The other thing, you know, he's sitting down cooking. Like, that's like the cardinal sin, my chef. You know, I mean, I get it. He's home and everything, but you stand up and you do your cut work. That shows me that he's a lazy chef. I'm not saying that he's the chef and a lazy cook. Like, most people that cook stand up cooking.\n",
    "0:18 Holding the knife down with his left hand here, he holds the tip of the knife down on the cutting board and with his right hand he moves in an up-and-down motion across the surface of the cutting board. Obviously all of the onions are underneath the knife and are getting diced. This is actually a reasonable way to dice onions if your onion starts from a pre-sliced state.\n",
    "0:24 This is a pretty good rocking technique, hold the knife at one end and then rock back and forth. That way there's no slippage.\n",
    "0:24 On a positive note, he's showing pretty decent knife work, rough chopping the onions. That's pretty impressive.\n",
    "0:29 And you can see this kind of spells onion a lot of places. He has to bring it back into a central group, but he is able to accomplish kind of cutting that onion down by using this technique. So, but not being probably very confident or competent in the kitchen, this is a fairly smart play.\n",
    "0:33 Here the preparer is drawing the knife blade across the cutting board in an effort to move the onion that he has been cutting. By drawing this knife blade across the cutting board, you are dulling that knife blade each time that you draw it across the board. So a better way to do this would be to flip the knife over, use the spine of the knife to draw along the board and to move anything around.\n",
    "0:37 He continues this motion over and over and over again until he has his onions chopped or minced to his liking.\n",
    "0:40 Here he's breaking down the onions to a smaller manageable bite size.\n",
    "01:17 Now, he should take that with onions and put it right in the bowl so he can give himself some time to work on the tomatoes.\n",
    "01:19 The preparer has finished chopping the onion and is getting ready to chop the tomato. He has left the chopped onion on the cutting board and is going to begin cutting the tomatoes. It is recommended that after each ingredient is cut or prepared that it be transferred to a mixing bowl. This way you've got the entire space of the cutting board to cut with and it will make it a lot easier to finish the tasks.\n",
    "01:28 Now he's got some grape tomatoes he's cutting and he's about to try to employ that same thing it looks like because his hand is on the tip of this which um I would well let's see what happens.\n",
    "01:32 Once his onions are chopped to his liking, he groups them on one section of the cutting board here. He should probably at this point have transferred the onions to his mixing bowl so that he would have adequate room to work on the next vegetable, which is his tomatoes.\n",
    "01:33 Yeah, so I would not do that with a tomato. First of all, tomatoes are round, so they roll. You wanna make sure you've got control over the tomato itself. And second of all, it's just not a good way to cut them. They don't really lend themselves because they have that hollow sort of wet inside. They're just gonna kind of squish.\n",
    "01:38 And now he's opted to just cut in half.\n",
    "01:41 The preparer is having to use a slight sawing motion to cut through the tomatoes. This is an indication that the knife blade is not sharp. So it is recommended that any time cutting is being done that the user of the knife ensure that it is sharp at the beginning, and if not, to use a sharpening stone or a sharpening tool to sharpen the knife.\n",
    "01:49 He is grabbing each tomato, it looks like a grape tomato, out of this container here one by one and cutting it in half crosswise.\n",
    "01:51 I would like to see him cut the tomatoes lengthwise. It makes for a better presentation. Right now, this is gonna be a, I can't say sloppy, but it's not, it just looks more uniform when you cut the tomato, this is specialty cherry tomato, lengthwise instead of half, cut it the long way.\n",
    "02:00 Here he has a small cucumber. It's like a mini cucumber. Kind of popular these days. It is an English cucumber with very few or any seeds that is kind of harvested when it's young.\n",
    "02:03 He cuts off about a three inch section of a small baby cucumber and sets the balance aside for another time.\n",
    "02:05 Here he's cut it in half, so he has two halves. He's cut it in half crosswise.\n",
    "02:06 He needs to really get himself some more room to work with and definitely work on his hand placement while holding the cucumber and how he's handling the knife.\n",
    "02:07 Well, here he should probably move some of that stuff off the cutting board. Probably in a bowl that he's going to mix that salad in so he can create more space on his cutting board.\n",
    "02:07 He's cut the end off.\n",
    "02:08 Here the end of the cucumber was cut off and just placed at the top of the cutting board. It is a recommended practice to have a small bowl or other container readily available near your preparation area to put any scraps that are generated during the cooking process.\n",
    "02:10 And now this is also not a terrible thing to do when you're holding something round, but holding it on both sides and using that internal area of your hand to use the knife, then you can't really cut yourself.\n",
    "02:11 After cutting off about a half inch thick tip from this cucumber section, he cuts it in half lengthwise.\n",
    "02:13 Now he's turned it again to get another cut. That would kind of give him four sticks.\n",
    "02:16 The preparer takes the cucumber and cuts lengthwise into quarters. He then cuts 90 degrees to the lengthwise cuts, creating basically a dice of the cucumber. A safer way to do this would have been to cut lengthwise, place the flat halves of the cucumber on the cutting board, make your second lengthwise cut, and then cut across into the cubes. The hazard, or the potential hazard, when trying to cut anything that is rounded is that the item you're cutting has the tendency to slip, and when that happens, the knife can slip and cause cuts.\n",
    "02:17 Here's where his fingers are vulnerable. See where he's holding his cucumber with his fingers pushed out. He should be pressing his fingertips down on the cutting, I mean, on the cucumber, and actually using a flat cut side of them. He's holding the whole barrel and it's already cut, and cucumbers are wet inside, so they tend to slip. It's just probably not the best use of his hand to be holding all four pieces at once.\n",
    "02:27 Then he slices it into half-inch thick slices and then proceeds to do the same technique as he did with the onions which is holding the tip of the knife down on the cutting board with his left hand and moving the knife up and down in a backwards and forwards motion across all of the cucumbers that are that are sliced.\n",
    "02:29 And here he goes back to that sort of chop thing.\n",
    "02:31 The preparer has cut up what was beautiful cubes of cucumber for the salad, and then he is mincing the cucumber. So by mincing this cucumber, it's really going to create mush, because a good portion of that cucumber is seeds. So what you're doing is destroying the integrity of the vegetable, and for a salad, you want that crunch or that bite to the various ingredients.\n",
    "02:40 It's here that you can see that he has like just very average knife skills Outside of the fact that he's seated which is a very awkward position to be Executing these tasks. He doesn't seem very comfortable with the knife and he doesn't seem like he has any Rama reason or technique To what he's doing It's just very random\n",
    "02:44 I would have preferred to see him keep the cucumbers a little bigger and have them around the same size instead of rough chopping it. I can understand rough chopping the onions. Nobody really wants to eat a big onion. But you want to have the cucumber and the tomato maybe around the same size. It goes with better presentation and a better texture and contrast for the salad.\n",
    "02:55 Here you can see that once all of his vegetables are cut, he moves them by hand in batches from the cutting board to this mixing bowl. He actually would be better served by holding the bowl underneath the table here and dragging all of the vegetables directly from the cutting board down into the mixing bowl. It would be much more efficient that way.\n",
    "03:03 The cut vegetables are now being placed into a medium-sized bowl for mixing.\n",
    "03:12 So now he's put all of the chopped vegetables into a bowl.\n",
    "03:18 I like it. It's a good habit that he paused as soon as he realized that he hadn't washed his hands.\n",
    "03:23 The next step is seasoning his salad. Here you can see that he has a black pepper grinder and he is going to grind that directly into his salad. I always recommend using a measuring spoon when seasoning a salad so that you know exactly how much seasoning you're adding to the finished dish.\n",
    "03:26 And he's adding some freshly ground black pepper, which is a delicious addition, a little bit of heat, not hot, hot heat, unless he just puts a ton on there, but it's very fresh and earthy, especially when it's freshly ground.\n",
    "03:36 Seasoning with salt and pepper.\n",
    "03:41 and a sprinkle of salt.\n",
    "03:42 Here you can see that he is adding a pinch of salt, which I assume to be about an eighth of a teaspoon, which would be a sufficient amount of salt for this recipe. However, again, I would like to see him use a measuring spoon to execute this task.\n",
    "03:56 And here he's adding some oil of some sort. Oil is a great addition. It's got a very slick mouth feel against the cool vegetables. The salt is going to bring out liquid in the vegetables, which will mingle again with the oil nicely and they will have a good flavor depending on what kind of oil you use. And you can use any kind of oil from a toasted walnut oil to this may be just an olive oil.\n",
    "04:06 He eyeballs about a teaspoon of balsamic vinegar and pours that directly into the mixing bowl. This is the acid that he's using in this dish, which is a key component to a cucumber and tomato salad. However, again, I would like to see him use a measuring spoon or a liquid measuring cup to determine how much to add. A tablespoon or two is adequate for a salad of this size.\n",
    "04:18 I appreciate the fact that he put all of his seasonings in, one after another. Now he's going to mix them up so they can be equally spread out throughout the dish. That's the way you properly season things. Sometimes I see people that might throw the salt in, then stir it. Might throw the pepper in, then stir it. Might throw the oil in, then stir it. You know, to effectively incorporate all your flavors and all your seasonings, you put everything in the bowl, then you turn it all at once. Good execution.\n",
    "04:18 Salt, pepper, and an unknown liquid have been added to the salad, and the salad is being mixed. It's important that once the salad has been seasoned, that the person preparing the salad tastes that salad to ensure that the flavor is balanced. In this case, it appears to be missing half of the dressing components. So with the dressing, you're going to want some sort of oil. In this case, olive oil would be nice. And then balance that with some sort of acid, such as red wine vinegar or fresh lemon juice. And once everything is combined, then you want to make sure that all the flavors are well balanced and make any adjustments at that point to the seasoning.\n",
    "04:19 His last step is tossing all of the ingredients to combine, which he is doing here with a metal spoon. This is an appropriate tool selection for this task.\n",
    "04:23 Nir's taking a spoon and he's able to stir everything together so you want everything to get well coated. You want the salt and the pepper to be well distributed and everything to be mixed together. I would like to assert that his onion ratio to the rest of the vegetables is off balance and he probably needs to dial back the onion by at least half. He has very little tomato, a little bit of cucumber, and then a whole lot of onion.\n",

The questions should be based on a video of a person executing the task and expert commentary with relative timestamps. I will provide video action narrations, keysteps and the commentary made by the expert in this field with their relative timestamps and you will generate three diverse highly video-grounded questions/answer pairs making the most out of the expert commentary. These questions should be natural and general without making directly reference to what is happening but instead by implying it, such as:\n",
      "- Can you suggest a tip for this part?\n",
      "- Is the amount of oil I'm using excessive?\n",

      "Expert commentary:\n",
      "0:06 So to start I'd say typically you don't sit down to cut. Now I'm not exactly sure what the circumstances here. He does have adequate counter space that is regular height to cut on. He just may be used to doing it this way but I would encourage anyone at the beginning of their culinary journey to not take this as the norm. It's not a good position to be in. It's you just don't have a lot of control when you're seated and cutting.\n",
      "0:07 First of all, I would like to see him giving himself more room to work with. He's got a whole bunch of ingredients that has nothing to do with the dish that he's making. He's making cucumber tomato salad. He has eggs. Yes. Sugar. He has a little bit of everything in his work area. So he should be able to give himself some room just so he can get stuff done in a timely fashion and not be working in a bunch of clutter.\n",
      "0:09 The first step to making a cucumber and tomato salad is to gather all of your ingredients that you will need for the recipe and to set up your workspace. You can see here that he has a cutting board and a chef's knife here in front of him. He is sitting in a chair which is never recommended when you're cutting anything. You need to be standing up on flat feet at a workspace that's at an adequate level for your height. However, he does have his ingredients handy. He has some pre-sliced red onion here that he is grabbing from a bowl and transferring to the cutting board in batches.\n",
      "0:11 So he has some already sliced onion here. They're in slivers, and he's just moved a handful of them to his cutting board.\n",
      "0:13 And he's using a technique that's pretty good for keeping your hands out of the way by holding the top of his knife down and then using this hand right here to rock the knife over the onions. It kind of is an indication that he's not very comfortable with his knife and that he's sort of just chopping at it, but it still is better than putting his fingers in jeopardy. Now what would be better is if he actually flattened this hand over the tip of the knife and didn't hold it so close. But again, fingers out of the way is what you're going for.\n",
      "0:15 Here the preparer has taken some sliced onion and is proceeding to chop it up using a chef's knife and using good knife skills where he's holding down the tip of the knife and using his arm to create a rocking motion with the knife to cut the sliced onion. Now an easier way to do this would be to start with either a whole or half an onion. If you're starting with a whole onion, cut it in half, pole to pole, stem to root. Peel it and then make vertical cuts with the point of the knife towards the root but not cutting all the way through the back of the onion. Your vertical cuts are going to be spaced depending on the size of the dice you want. So once you've made your vertical cuts, you're going to turn the onion 90 degrees and cut 90 degrees to the vertical cut, spacing the size you want your dice. And that will give you diced onion very quickly.\n",
      "0:16 The other thing, you know, he's sitting down cooking. Like, that's like the cardinal sin, my chef. You know, I mean, I get it. He's home and everything, but you stand up and you do your cut work. That shows me that he's a lazy chef. I'm not saying that he's the chef and a lazy cook. Like, most people that cook stand up cooking.\n",
      "0:18 Holding the knife down with his left hand here, he holds the tip of the knife down on the cutting board and with his right hand he moves in an up-and-down motion across the surface of the cutting board. Obviously all of the onions are underneath the knife and are getting diced. This is actually a reasonable way to dice onions if your onion starts from a pre-sliced state.\n",
      "0:24 This is a pretty good rocking technique, hold the knife at one end and then rock back and forth. That way there's no slippage.\n",
      "0:24 On a positive note, he's showing pretty decent knife work, rough chopping the onions. That's pretty impressive.\n",
      "0:29 And you can see this kind of spells onion a lot of places. He has to bring it back into a central group, but he is able to accomplish kind of cutting that onion down by using this technique. So, but not being probably very confident or competent in the kitchen, this is a fairly smart play.\n",
      "0:33 Here the preparer is drawing the knife blade across the cutting board in an effort to move the onion that he has been cutting. By drawing this knife blade across the cutting board, you are dulling that knife blade each time that you draw it across the board. So a better way to do this would be to flip the knife over, use the spine of the knife to draw along the board and to move anything around.\n",
      "0:37 He continues this motion over and over and over again until he has his onions chopped or minced to his liking.\n",
      "0:40 Here he's breaking down the onions to a smaller manageable bite size.\n",
      "01:17 Now, he should take that with onions and put it right in the bowl so he can give himself some time to work on the tomatoes.\n",
      "01:19 The preparer has finished chopping the onion and is getting ready to chop the tomato. He has left the chopped onion on the cutting board and is going to begin cutting the tomatoes. It is recommended that after each ingredient is cut or prepared that it be transferred to a mixing bowl. This way you've got the entire space of the cutting board to cut with and it will make it a lot easier to finish the tasks.\n",
      "01:28 Now he's got some grape tomatoes he's cutting and he's about to try to employ that same thing it looks like because his hand is on the tip of this which um I would well let's see what happens.\n",
      "01:32 Once his onions are chopped to his liking, he groups them on one section of the cutting board here. He should probably at this point have transferred the onions to his mixing bowl so that he would have adequate room to work on the next vegetable, which is his tomatoes.\n",
      "01:33 Yeah, so I would not do that with a tomato. First of all, tomatoes are round, so they roll. You wanna make sure you've got control over the tomato itself. And second of all, it's just not a good way to cut them. They don't really lend themselves because they have that hollow sort of wet inside. They're just gonna kind of squish.\n",
      "01:38 And now he's opted to just cut in half.\n",
      "01:41 The preparer is having to use a slight sawing motion to cut through the tomatoes. This is an indication that the knife blade is not sharp. So it is recommended that any time cutting is being done that the user of the knife ensure that it is sharp at the beginning, and if not, to use a sharpening stone or a sharpening tool to sharpen the knife.\n",
      "01:49 He is grabbing each tomato, it looks like a grape tomato, out of this container here one by one and cutting it in half crosswise.\n",
      "01:51 I would like to see him cut the tomatoes lengthwise. It makes for a better presentation. Right now, this is gonna be a, I can't say sloppy, but it's not, it just looks more uniform when you cut the tomato, this is specialty cherry tomato, lengthwise instead of half, cut it the long way.\n",
      "02:00 Here he has a small cucumber. It's like a mini cucumber. Kind of popular these days. It is an English cucumber with very few or any seeds that is kind of harvested when it's young.\n",
      "02:03 He cuts off about a three inch section of a small baby cucumber and sets the balance aside for another time.\n",
      "02:05 Here he's cut it in half, so he has two halves. He's cut it in half crosswise.\n",
      "02:06 He needs to really get himself some more room to work with and definitely work on his hand placement while holding the cucumber and how he's handling the knife.\n",
      "02:07 Well, here he should probably move some of that stuff off the cutting board. Probably in a bowl that he's going to mix that salad in so he can create more space on his cutting board.\n",
      "02:07 He's cut the end off.\n",
      "02:08 Here the end of the cucumber was cut off and just placed at the top of the cutting board. It is a recommended practice to have a small bowl or other container readily available near your preparation area to put any scraps that are generated during the cooking process.\n",
      "02:10 And now this is also not a terrible thing to do when you're holding something round, but holding it on both sides and using that internal area of your hand to use the knife, then you can't really cut yourself.\n",
      "02:11 After cutting off about a half inch thick tip from this cucumber section, he cuts it in half lengthwise.\n",
      "02:13 Now he's turned it again to get another cut. That would kind of give him four sticks.\n",
      "02:16 The preparer takes the cucumber and cuts lengthwise into quarters. He then cuts 90 degrees to the lengthwise cuts, creating basically a dice of the cucumber. A safer way to do this would have been to cut lengthwise, place the flat halves of the cucumber on the cutting board, make your second lengthwise cut, and then cut across into the cubes. The hazard, or the potential hazard, when trying to cut anything that is rounded is that the item you're cutting has the tendency to slip, and when that happens, the knife can slip and cause cuts.\n",
      "02:17 Here's where his fingers are vulnerable. See where he's holding his cucumber with his fingers pushed out. He should be pressing his fingertips down on the cutting, I mean, on the cucumber, and actually using a flat cut side of them. He's holding the whole barrel and it's already cut, and cucumbers are wet inside, so they tend to slip. It's just probably not the best use of his hand to be holding all four pieces at once.\n",
      "02:27 Then he slices it into half-inch thick slices and then proceeds to do the same technique as he did with the onions which is holding the tip of the knife down on the cutting board with his left hand and moving the knife up and down in a backwards and forwards motion across all of the cucumbers that are that are sliced.\n",
      "02:29 And here he goes back to that sort of chop thing.\n",
      "02:31 The preparer has cut up what was beautiful cubes of cucumber for the salad, and then he is mincing the cucumber. So by mincing this cucumber, it's really going to create mush, because a good portion of that cucumber is seeds. So what you're doing is destroying the integrity of the vegetable, and for a salad, you want that crunch or that bite to the various ingredients.\n",
      "02:40 It's here that you can see that he has like just very average knife skills Outside of the fact that he's seated which is a very awkward position to be Executing these tasks. He doesn't seem very comfortable with the knife and he doesn't seem like he has any Rama reason or technique To what he's doing It's just very random\n",
      "02:44 I would have preferred to see him keep the cucumbers a little bigger and have them around the same size instead of rough chopping it. I can understand rough chopping the onions. Nobody really wants to eat a big onion. But you want to have the cucumber and the tomato maybe around the same size. It goes with better presentation and a better texture and contrast for the salad.\n",
      "02:55 Here you can see that once all of his vegetables are cut, he moves them by hand in batches from the cutting board to this mixing bowl. He actually would be better served by holding the bowl underneath the table here and dragging all of the vegetables directly from the cutting board down into the mixing bowl. It would be much more efficient that way.\n",
      "03:03 The cut vegetables are now being placed into a medium-sized bowl for mixing.\n",
      "03:12 So now he's put all of the chopped vegetables into a bowl.\n",
      "03:18 I like it. It's a good habit that he paused as soon as he realized that he hadn't washed his hands.\n",
      "03:23 The next step is seasoning his salad. Here you can see that he has a black pepper grinder and he is going to grind that directly into his salad. I always recommend using a measuring spoon when seasoning a salad so that you know exactly how much seasoning you're adding to the finished dish.\n",
      "03:26 And he's adding some freshly ground black pepper, which is a delicious addition, a little bit of heat, not hot, hot heat, unless he just puts a ton on there, but it's very fresh and earthy, especially when it's freshly ground.\n",
      "03:36 Seasoning with salt and pepper.\n",
      "03:41 and a sprinkle of salt.\n",
      "03:42 Here you can see that he is adding a pinch of salt, which I assume to be about an eighth of a teaspoon, which would be a sufficient amount of salt for this recipe. However, again, I would like to see him use a measuring spoon to execute this task.\n",
      "03:56 And here he's adding some oil of some sort. Oil is a great addition. It's got a very slick mouth feel against the cool vegetables. The salt is going to bring out liquid in the vegetables, which will mingle again with the oil nicely and they will have a good flavor depending on what kind of oil you use. And you can use any kind of oil from a toasted walnut oil to this may be just an olive oil.\n",
      "04:06 He eyeballs about a teaspoon of balsamic vinegar and pours that directly into the mixing bowl. This is the acid that he's using in this dish, which is a key component to a cucumber and tomato salad. However, again, I would like to see him use a measuring spoon or a liquid measuring cup to determine how much to add. A tablespoon or two is adequate for a salad of this size.\n",
      "04:18 I appreciate the fact that he put all of his seasonings in, one after another. Now he's going to mix them up so they can be equally spread out throughout the dish. That's the way you properly season things. Sometimes I see people that might throw the salt in, then stir it. Might throw the pepper in, then stir it. Might throw the oil in, then stir it. You know, to effectively incorporate all your flavors and all your seasonings, you put everything in the bowl, then you turn it all at once. Good execution.\n",
      "04:18 Salt, pepper, and an unknown liquid have been added to the salad, and the salad is being mixed. It's important that once the salad has been seasoned, that the person preparing the salad tastes that salad to ensure that the flavor is balanced. In this case, it appears to be missing half of the dressing components. So with the dressing, you're going to want some sort of oil. In this case, olive oil would be nice. And then balance that with some sort of acid, such as red wine vinegar or fresh lemon juice. And once everything is combined, then you want to make sure that all the flavors are well balanced and make any adjustments at that point to the seasoning.\n",
      "04:19 His last step is tossing all of the ingredients to combine, which he is doing here with a metal spoon. This is an appropriate tool selection for this task.\n",
      "04:23 Nir's taking a spoon and he's able to stir everything together so you want everything to get well coated. You want the salt and the pepper to be well distributed and everything to be mixed together. I would like to assert that his onion ratio to the rest of the vegetables is off balance and he probably needs to dial back the onion by at least half. He has very little tomato, a little bit of cucumber, and then a whole lot of onion.\n",

      "02:16 A safer way to do this would have been to cut lengthwise, place the flat halves of the cucumber on the cutting board, make your second lengthwise cut, and then cut across into the cubes.\n",
      "02:16 The hazard, or the potential hazard, when trying to cut anything that is rounded is that the item you're cutting has the tendency to slip, and when that happens the knife can slip and cause cuts.\n",
